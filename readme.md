# Sweet Web

## Project Goal
Sweet Web is a visually impaired friendly web project, aims to help [甜裡開始](https://www.facebook.com/sweet51909/). We integrate “VoiceOver”, which is a screen reader built into iOS, so that the manager of the café can use a few simple gestures to navigate the website and easily manage the basic operations (POS system, order queue and more) of the café shop.
