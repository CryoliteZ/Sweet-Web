# Sweet Web

## Project Goal
Sweet Web is a visually impaired friendly web project, aims to help [甜裡開始] cafe(https://www.facebook.com/sweet51909/). We integrate “VoiceOver”, which is a screen reader built into iOS, so that the manager of the café can use a few simple gestures to navigate the website and easily manage the basic operations (POS system, order queue and more) of the café shop.

Using the menu as example, all the categories and products are grouped in a simple list. Users could use VoiceOver to navigate through the list, find out which product he/she wants to order (from voice), and click to add to cart

Different components serves as different functions. Once an action is completed, the web app will use text-to-speech to notify the user.
